已知，这里的数据均为正向化指标，故无需进行正向化,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
标准化的目的是消除不同量纲的影响,,,,,,,,,,,,
对矩阵进行标准化：每一个元素/ sqrt（其所在列的元素的平方和）,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"矩阵 = 【x2011,sale  x2011,have  x2011,percent  ;    x2012,sale     x2012,have    x2012,percent ;              .......】",,,,,,,,,,,,

为了给3个指标确定权重，我们使用熵权法来进行计算,,,,,,,,,,,,
对于第 j 个指标，信息熵的计算公式为：,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ej = (-1 /ln n) * sum(i = 1 to n)(p_ij * ln p_ij)         j = 1,(sale) 2(have),3(percent)",,,,,,,,,,,,
其中 p_ij = z_ij / sum(i = 1 to n)(z_ij),,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
先计算p矩阵的p_ij,,,,,,,,,,,,

3. 计算得分并归一化,,,,,,,,,,,,
定义最大值,"Z+   =  (Z1+,    Z2+,   Z3+)   =  ( max{z11, z21, .., zn1} ,  max{z12,z22, ..., zn2} , max{z13, z23, ... , zn3}   )",,,,,,,,,,,
定义最小值,"Z-    =   (Z1-,     Z2-,    Z3-)    =   (min{一样}   ,   min {一样}， min{一样})",,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"定义第i（i=1，2，..., n）评价对象(年份)与最大值的距离",,,,,,,,,,,,
Di+  = sqrt(sum(j = 1 to m) (Zj+  - z_ij)平方  ),,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
"定义第i（i=1，2，..., n）评价对象(年份)与最小值的距离",,,,,,,,,,,,
Di-  = sqrt(sum(j = 1 to m) (Zj-  - z_ij)平方  ),,,,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,,,
我们可以计算得出第i（i=1，2，...，n）个评价对象未归一化的得分：,,,,,,,,,,,,
Si = Di- / （Di+  +    Di-）,,,,,,,,,,,,
